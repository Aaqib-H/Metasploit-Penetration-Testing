# Metasploit Penetration Testing

## Project Description
The project aimed to perform a full-spectrum vulnerability assessment and penetration test in a controlled VMware environment. The primary focus was on identifying, exploiting, and reporting vulnerabilities using Metasploit and  Nmap, ultimately providing insights and recommendations to strengthen security measures.


### Report
Authored detailed penetration testing reports with results to help companies fix vulnerabilites.

### Tools Used

- **VMware Workstation** for a controlled environment through virtualization.
- **Metasploitable 2** as the victim machine.
- **Kali Linux** as the attacking machine.
- **Nmap** for network traffic analysis

### Skills Learned
